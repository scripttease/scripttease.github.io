## Changing the World with Javascript Node.js  Callbacks

I like functional programming, so I don't love mutable states. But if you want to use async functions with Node.js, you have to use callbacks and *that* means changing the world... Or at least mutating state.

It took me a miserably long time to understand callbacks so I'm going to explain how I got there.
